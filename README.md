# Gek
Create an imaginary country, with its own language, culture, geography, hydrography your flag

- Created the first draft of the country Gek, where its inhabitants the Gekos and the Gekas communicate through a simple sound, Gek! , which intonate higher or lower according to the intention of the message.
- They are a peaceful people, without crime, without violence, where everyone is treated equally, no matter the color, the clothes, even where they live, they are guided by mutual respect, altruism to help the project without judging, without looking at the details, and practice a philosophy based on doing your neighbors as much good as you can, before the day ends.
- No se preocupan por tasas de trabajo, ¡¡¡ No existen bancos, pues jamas existio el dinero!!!, para ellos todo es de todos y de nadie a la vez, la mesa siempre esta lista, se ayudan unos a otros sin necesidad de tener que pedirlo pues siempre estan pendientes de que pueden ofrecer y no de que les pueden ofrecer.
- This philosophy of life that I tell in broad strokes, causes amazement in other civilizations, even in other worlds, many do not understand, others do not accept, and many others simply do not want to think about that way of life; The mayor of a village in a nearby world visits them for decades in a speleology program of their "Material" world, that’s his name;
- The result was disastrous, several members of Material reacted violently, other scandalized refused to go down to the surface, because as it was possible that way of life, you do not have slaves that provide you a social status, economic, while you can walk through life boasting of an ostentisity achieved with the sacrifice of health, time and knowledge of others; What is that knowledge is shared altruistically and all collaborate with everyone, As expected, the visit was extremely short.
- The Geks, on the other hand, did not understand what was the cause of such an angry reaction, and much less understood why several of these extravagant visitors constantly needed those noisy ones called animated bank, that he was no more than an equal one who was glued to the side of his peers awarded everywhere and that with a simple gesture of a small extension of his clamp, probossing the rapid reaction of his equal one who bowed in front of this like a bench, just so your equal could access a box held by several of your peers, I understand that all this is highly confusing, imagine for a Gek.
- What need did their peers have to force themselves to such tasks, were they perhaps incapable? , were they sick?.
- Indeed, these Materilites are very wandering beings.
